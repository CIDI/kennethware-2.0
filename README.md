Tools to facilitate rapid course development in Instructure Canvas.

To learn about these tools and how to install them visit: https://usu.instructure.com/courses/305202

Due to the difficulties of trying to maintain an open source tool on top of the ever changing Canvas platform, these tools are no longer updated or maintained. What was intended to become version 3.0 is offered as a SaaS solution through a company called Cidi Labs. For those interested in this type of functionality in Canvas, I recommend you look at Cidi Labs DesignPLUS (https://cidilabs.com/landing/design-tools/).
